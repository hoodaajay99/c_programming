- General Purpose procedural programming Language
- C is one of the most widely used computer languages
- Developed in `1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie` at the Bell Telephone Laboratories
- Used initially to develop the UNIX operating system
- One of the most used programming Languages of all time. 
- [Refer: Current ranking of C Programming Language]([https://link](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/))

### Facts about C Language
- C is a successor of B language
- C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX
- First verison of of C was formalized in 1988.
- This verison was called ANSI C.
- ANSI stands for __American National Standard Institute__
- C is one of the most widely used System Programming Language
- Most Operating Systems have been writtem in C including Linux and Android
- Most Databases like RDBMS MySQL have been written in C
- Most Emdedded devices are programmed in C
- Most compilers, like GNU gcc etc have been written in C
- Most IOT (Internet of things) devices have been written in C.

### C Programming Language Standards

There have been major four versions/standards of C Programming Language

> Standardization helps in portability between compilers

- C89/C90 
  - Published by the `American National Standards Institute` (ANSI)
  - Published around 1989, 1990
- C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999)
  - New features - inline, long long int
  - Added Standard library
- C11 (ISO/IEC 9899:2011)
  - Multi-threading support
  - Anonymous structures and unions
- C18 (ISO/IEC 9899:2018)
  - No new language features
  - bugfix release

> Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

## Why VS Code for C Programming
So far IDEs like CodeBlocks, Xcode, Visual Studio have been used for C/C++ programming and are the IDEs of choice. You are free to use them for this course.

But I have decided to use VS code for following reasons - 
- Support for C/C++ has been added in early 2019
- Built in Git - Version control system
- Intellisense: syntax highlighting and autocomplete
- Vibrant community
- Ease of use, great coding experience.

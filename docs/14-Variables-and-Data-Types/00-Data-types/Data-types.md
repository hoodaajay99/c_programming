## What is a Data Type ?

- Each variable in C and C++ has an associated data type. 
- The type defines how much space it occupies in memory
- The type defines operations that can be performed over the variable.

For Example:

`int age;` defines that age is of type `integer` and stores values like `10, 40, 80 ` etc, requires 32 bits of memory to store (sizeof operator) and `+, -, *, /, %` operations can be performed on the type.

## Data Types in C

The types in C can be classified as follows:

| Types | Description |
|--|--|
| Basic Types | They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types. |
| Enumerated types | Enums are used to define named constants of type integer |
| The `void` Type | Special type that indicates no value is available |
| The `void` Type | Special type that indicates no value is available |
| Derived types | Derived from Basic Types and include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types. |

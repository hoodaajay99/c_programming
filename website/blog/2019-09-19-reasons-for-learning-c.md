C is a middle level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s while working at AT&T Bell Labs in USA. 

The objective of its development was in the context of the re-design of the UNIX operating system to enable it to be used on multiple computers.

C was developed during 1971-73, containing both high-level functionality and the detailed features required to program an operating system. Hence, many of the UNIX components including UNIX kernel itself re written in C.

Later on in 1988, C Language was standardized as ANSI C. Further in 1990, ANSI C was approved by the International Standards Organization (ISO).

C99 standard was the next revision; it was published in 1999 and introduced new features like advanced data types etc.

The C language has formed the basis for many languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Limbo, LPC, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, Verilog and C-shell.


## C is a Middle-Level Language

C Language lies between the _Low-level languages_ which are closer to the hardware just such as `assembly languages` and _High-Level_ user friendly languages like `Python or Javascript`.

C Language being _middle level language_ can be used for writing operating systems, compilers and also doing application level programming. 

## Helps to understand the fundamentals of Computer Science

Most aspects of computers science like _Computer Networks_, _Compiler Designing_ and _Operating Systems_  etc are based on C programming language.

Most of the Computer science fields now a days like _system programming_, _Embedded Systems Programming_, _Programming IOT devices and Sensors_, writing _device drivers_, _network adapters_ etc require robust C programming skills.

## Programs writtem in C Language execure very fast and efficiently

Modern C runtimes and Compilers create very efficient code which runs very fast on CPU. Also compilers allow us to utilize fast memory access mechnisms like CPU Cache. 

Also C programming language does not have any additional processing overheads such as garbage collection or preventing memory leaks etc. The programmer must take care of these things on his own. This makes it really fast and efficient.

## Vast Application Areas and Use Cases

C is consistently amongst most used programming languages for last many decades. Application areas and Use Cases for C programming languages have grown many folds in last many years. Some of the application areas include: 

- Embedded Programming
- Internet Of Thing and Sensor Devices
- Micro-controller programming
- micro-Processor programming
- Linux Kernel Subsystem
- Device Drivers
- automotives, Robotics and Hardware Devices
- Gaming applications
- Major Operating Systems
- Major compilers even for other programming languages
- GNU and Linux Subsystem

## C is the elementary language of all programming languages

Once you learn C language, conceptually it becomes easier to learn high level programming languages. The C language has formed the basis for many languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Limbo, LPC, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, Verilog and C-shell.

## C is a structured programming language 

Allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs and complex data to be assembled and managed in structures. It also allows free movement of data across functions.

## Simple to learn

C Programming language is Simple to learn. Once you understand the concepts it becomes very interesting to work with.

## C language has a worldwide recognition

Major tech companies like _Google_, _Facebook_, _Microsoft_, _Amazon_ etc recognize the C language and have openings for people working in C language.
